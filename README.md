# Cinema
My and my friend's Krzysztof first study project in objective C++ :)
You can see UML diagram how it looks from the inside.
App contains only text UI with instructions.

In this app when you know the password ;) you can be a cinema admin who can add new movie,
or a customer who can choose the movie by its genre and buy a ticket for a movie (even more than 1 ticket)
